#neoneggshell
NES (NeonEggShell) is an iOS and OS X command shell creation tool written in python.  This tool creates an command line session with extra functionality like downloading files, taking pictures, location tracking, and gathering data on a target.  NeonEggshell runs inside a Mach-o executable on the target machine and deletes itself upon execution. This program is very easy to use and extremely lightweight.
